# tabweave
Planning/design tool for tablet weaving

The project is started, but not yet ready for any use.

The long term plan is a tool for planning tablet weaving, displaying graphically what the frontside and backside may look like. Also, an ability to print such patterns and weaving directions.  It will be a standalone tool, not depending on the web for use.

## Planned features
- Support various tablets: 2, 3, 4, 6 or 8 holes. Possibly others as well.
- Threads of any color.
- Rotation of all tablets, or selected groups for making patterns.
- Flipping tablets (pattern effect)
- Reordering tablets
- Changing the number of tablets while weaving. Usually for making a tapered end.

## Use
Prepare a text file with weaving instructions. This file should specify the kind of tablets, how many, the threading and orientation of each.

Then the weaving, the rotation of tablets and other possible operations between wefts.  

The tool should then produce images of the front and back sides.

## Completed
- nothing yet
